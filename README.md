# bst-database
*/ I struggled most with figuring out how to do prefix searching, especially how to create the upper bound for the alphabetical range. I also had to think carefully about when and how to remove positions from the last-name index so that deleted records didn’t leave behind outdated references. Another challenge was making sure my code matched the exact functions and outputs expected by the BST class, especially for counting comparisons. I learned how indexes connect keys (like IDs or last names) to where records are stored. I also got a better understanding of soft deletion and how a record can be marked deleted without being removed from memory. I learned how range and prefix searches work when data is stored in a sorted structure like a BST, and I practiced using lambda functions as callbacks during tree traversal
